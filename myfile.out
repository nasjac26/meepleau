H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>", "faq"=>"<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it's not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned \"Reach Value\" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"w-50\" src=\"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/AMEwdJGV5c/root-the-clockwork-expansion\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'AMEwdJGV5c', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Root: The Clockwork Expansion</a> - Adds simulated opponent(s).

After Natalia moved to the U.S., she ran into <a href=\"/designer/MANNUPclkd/alan-stone\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Stone</a> through their kids' school, which led to her getting connected with <a href=\"/designer/QIz5pAPzFk/jamey-stegmaier\" target=\"_blank\">Jamey Stegmaier</a> of <a href=\"/publisher/njVFVNfJc7/stonemaier-games\" target=\"_blank\">Stonemaier Games</a>. Check out this interview <a href=\"/forum/XTO9WbDBqe/how-the-best-board-game-of-2019-wingspan-reunited-two-high-school-friends-interview\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\r\n<p>In an interview, designer <a href=\"/designer/UBhK4cSEV6/elizabeth-hargrave\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Hargrave</a> commented that she felt &quot;... there were too many games about castles and space, and not enough games about things I'm interested in. So I decided to make a game about something I cared about.&quot;</p>", "faq"=>"<p><strong>Is it hard to learn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The rulebook is well-organized and easy to follow. You can learn how to play the game after reading through 10 pages of rules accompanied by plenty of visual cues and breathing space between text. Alternatively, you can use the Quick-Reference Guide (page 2 of the Appendix) if you want to learn the game in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>Veteran gamers will find it relatively easy to learn and teach, while new gamers may feel that it's more complex than what they're used to. When it comes to learning the actual strategy, the game will likely \"click\" for the majority of the players by the time your group finishes the 1st Round (there are 4 Rounds total).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the game's simple turn structure and types of actions available, you'll quickly pick up on how the game works by watching your friends play. So while you may not be playing optimally or finding the best combos to pull off, you'll likely feel comfortable by the start of Round 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For those who've played Stonemaier Games' <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/7NYbgH2Z2I/viticulture-essential-edition\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '7NYbgH2Z2I', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Viticulture: Essential Edition</a>, Wingspan is less complex than Viticulture in terms of strategy elements and has fewer rules to memorize. If you have detailed questions about the game, you'll likely find an answer within this <a href=\"https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/rules/\">comprehensive FAQ</a> put together by Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it good for 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>2-player gameplay won't trigger pink bird powers as frequently, which are activated once per turn if a criteria is met during an opponent's turn (e.g. get \"X\" benefit when another player does \"Y\" action). There will also be less competition for valuable birds cards or for the food dice from the birdfeeder.</p>\r\n<p>Wingspan is a relatively low interaction game. This means that the gameplay won't feel much different at low or high player counts and makes for an easily scalable game. So if you love Wingspan at high player counts, you'll love it at 2-player count as well. On the other hand, if you're someone who prefers highly interactive games where your actions directly impact another player's strategies, you should try it out before making the purchase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is there a hand limit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is no limit to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play alone?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As with most Stonemaier Games titles, Wingspan comes with a separate set of rules for the Automa, an AI opponent that simulates playing against a human opponent. This game was rated #13 on \"2020 People's Choice Top 200 Solo Games.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first player is randomnly selected by your group. That player gets the first-player token and will kick off the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player with the most points wins. Tally up points for the following and determine the winner:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Points based on bird cards played on your tableau</li>\r\n<li>Points for bonus card(s) accomplished</li>\r\n<li>Points for end-of-round goals</li>\r\n<li>1 point for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Egg on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Food token cached on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Card tucked under a bird card</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In case of a tie, number of unused food tokens serve as tiebreaker. If still tied, they share the victory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What's inside the box?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>170 unique bird cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>26 bonus cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>16 Automa

If you're looking for a solid 2-player cooperative experience, get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I play online with my friends?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codenames.game/\">Codenames Online</a> is the official free-to-play digital adaptation of the board game. Create a room, send the invite link, and catch up with friends and families by playing a fun board game alongside your usual Zoom meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you play with 2 players?</strong></p>\n<p>The official rules include a 2-player variant to allow cooperative play against a simulated opponent. You can try this out even with a large group if they're not in the mood for competitive play. If you're looking for a strictly 2-player game, then I'd recommend <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>, which was specifically designed for a low player count.</p>\n<p><strong>How many guesses do you get every turn?</strong></p>\n<p>In every turn, the spymaster will say a one-word clue and a number, which tells the team how many codenames are associated with the clue. The team is allowed as many guesses as that number plus one extra. Taking this risk is a big part of the fun!</p>", "thumb_url"=>"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg", "image_url"=>"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg", "matches_specs"=>nil, "specs"=>[], "mechanics"=>[{"id"=>"0ez69aUfuJ", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/0ez69aUfuJ/undefined"}, {"id"=>"GsNGxZFNCK", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/GsNGxZFNCK/undefined"}, {"id"=>"r6yIFvyXDD", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/r6yIFvyXDD/undefined"}, {"id"=>"hmipYN1R1I", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/hmipYN1R1I/undefined"}, {"id"=>"9jnCsVuRat", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/mechanic/9jnCsVuRat/undefined"}], "categories"=>[{"id"=>"eX8uuNlQkQ", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/eX8uuNlQkQ/undefined"}, {"id"=>"ge8pIhEUGE", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/ge8pIhEUGE/undefined"}, {"id"=>"bCBXJy9qDw", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/bCBXJy9qDw/undefined"}, {"id"=>"7rV11PKqME", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/7rV11PKqME/undefined"}, {"id"=>"X8J7RM6dxX", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/X8J7RM6dxX/undefined"}, {"id"=>"rHvAx4hH2f", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/category/rHvAx4hH2f/undefined"}], "publishers"=>[{"id"=>"8eHESCflqX", "num_games"=>nil, "score"=>9999999, "game"=>{}, "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/8eHESCflqX/undefined", "images"=>{"thumb"=>nil, "small"=>nil, "medium"=>nil, "large"=>nil, "original"=>nil}}, {"id"=>"dGYFmIWLYs", "num_games"=>nil, "score"=>9999999, "game"=>{}, "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/dGYFmIWLYs/undefined", "images"=>{"thumb"=>nil, "small"=>nil, "medium"=>nil, "large"=>nil, "original"=>nil}}], "designers"=>[{"id"=>"3P2XFNApXh", "num_games"=>nil, "score"=>9999999, "game"=>{}, "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/3P2XFNApXh/undefined", "images"=>{"thumb"=>nil, "small"=>nil, "medium"=>nil, "large"=>nil, "original"=>nil}}], "primary_publisher"=>{"id"=>"8eHESCflqX", "name"=>"Czech Games Edition", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/publisher/8eHESCflqX/czech-games-edition"}, "primary_designer"=>{"id"=>"3P2XFNApXh", "name"=>"Vlaada Chvátil", "url"=>"https://www.boardgameatlas.com/designer/3P2XFNApXh/vlaada-chvtil"}, "developers"=>[], "related_to"=>[], "artists"=>["Stéphane Gantiez", "Tomáš Kučerovský"], "names"=>[], "rules_url"=>"https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf", "amazon_rank"=>36, "cs_rating"=>4.6, "official_url"=>"https://czechgames.com/en/codenames/?utm_source=boardgameatlas.com&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=bga_ads", "comment_count"=>0, "num_user_ratings"=>767, "average_user_rating"=>3.6675908572359868, "weight_amount"=>1.25, "weight_units"=>"lbs ", "size_height"=>9, "size_depth"=>2, "size_units"=>"inches ", "historical_low_prices"=>[{"country"=>"UK", "date"=>"2021-11-24T02:40:18.497Z", "price"=>13.59, "isLow"=>false}, {"country"=>"US", "date"=>"2021-11-28T13:25:05.863Z", "price"=>8.04, "isLow"=>true}, {"country"=>"CA", "date"=>"2021-11-30T05:48:46.759Z", "price"=>16.95, "isLow"=>false}, {"country"=>"AU", "date"=>"2021-12-01T12:27:59.160Z", "price"=>19.95, "isLow"=>false}], "active"=>true, "num_user_complexity_votes"=>10, "average_learning_complexity"=>1.1, "average_strategy_complexity"=>2.2, "visits"=>3486, "lists"=>1682, "mentions"=>88, "links"=>18, "plays"=>9949, "rank"=>12, "type"=>"game", "sku"=>"CGE00046", "upc"=>"8594156310462", "num_distributors"=>1, "trending_rank"=>0, "listing_clicks"=>0, "is_historical_low"=>true, "msrp_text"=>"$19.95", "price_text"=>"$8.04", "tags"=>["שם-קוד ", "Codenames XXL", "Codenames Afrikaans", "Codenames Arabic: رسائل سرية", "Codenames Edisi Indonesia", "Codi secret", "Código secreto", "Codinomes", "Fedőnevek", "Krycí jména", "Krycie mená", "Nome in Codice", "Nume de Cod", "Tajniacy", "Κωδική Ονομασία", "Кодові імена: гра слів", "Кодови имена", "Кодовые Имена", "שם-קוד", "الأسماء الحركية", "コードネーム", "機密代號", "機密代號: 廣東話版", "行动代号", "코드네임", "Codenames FR", "Codenames", "Codenames XXL Dutch Edition", "Codenames XXL Last Chance", "Codenames - Party Game", "Codenames Deep Undercover 2 0", "CODENAMES"], "images"=>{"thumb"=>"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/40x40/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg", "small"=>"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/150x150/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg", "medium"=>"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/350x350/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg", "large"=>"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg", "original"=>"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/5cc.images/games/uploaded/1559254183526-51f6ysXCMmL.jpg"}, "description_preview"=>" The two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents.

tiles form a landscape of cities, roads, fields, and monasteries. Claim these features with your followers to win the game. \r\n  Carcassonne  is a tile placement game where players collectively construct the area around the medieval French city of Carcassonne while competing to place followers on various features and score the most points. \r\n First published in 2000, the game's accessible yet deep design has attracted a wide fan base and led to the development of numerous expansions (eg Rivers) and standalone titles in the  Carcassonne  line.

In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pandemic Legacy</strong> is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic <em><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic\">Pandemic</a></em>, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.</p>\r\n<p>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.</p>\r\n<p>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.</p>\r\n<p>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.</p>", "commentary"=>"", "faq"=>"",

In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy. \r\n  Pandemic Legacy  is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic   Pandemic  , in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions. \r\n After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to. \r\n Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards. \r\n During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.

Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan?

Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>\r\n<p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>\r\n<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points.

Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!

into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.  To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's.

Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in <em>Santorini</em>!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><em><strong>Santorini</strong></em> is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton.</p>\r\n<p>Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Move</strong> - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Build</strong> - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Winning the game</strong> - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Variable player powers</strong> - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br /><br />Turns in <em>Santorini</em> are made up of two simple step: Move and Build.

Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in  Santorini ! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Santorini   is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton. \r\n Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps: \r\n  1. Move  - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels. \r\n  2. Build  - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play. \r\n  Winning the game  - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win. \r\n  Variable player powers  - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played. \r\n \r\n \r\n   Turns in  Santorini  are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game! Though, there are a few things that add a wrinkle to the basic formula.  Invoke the Power of the gods! Each player will have access to a god power which lets them do things a little differently than normal. Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of  Santorini  different and exciting! \r\n "}]]
